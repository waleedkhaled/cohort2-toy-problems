/**
  * Implement the `countLeaves` function in this Tree class.
  *
  * A leaf node is any node in the tree that has no children. `countLeaves` should
  * traverse the tree, and return the number of leaf nodes the tree contains.
  *
  * Illustration of a tree with three leaves:
  *
  *       * <- root
  *      / \
  *     *    * <- leaf
  *    / \
  *   *   * <- leaf
  *  /
  * * <- leaf
  *
  * Example usage:
  *   var root = new Tree();
  *   root.countLeaves(); // 1
  *   root.addChild(new Tree());
  *   root.countLeaves(); // still 1
  *   root.addChild(new Tree());
  *   root.children[0].addChild(new Tree());
  *   root.children[0].addChild(new Tree());
  *   root.children[0].children[0].addChild(new Tree());
  *   root.countLeaves(); // 3
  *
